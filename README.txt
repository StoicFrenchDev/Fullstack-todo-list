Created a simple CRUD app with Angular and Spring, based on todo list.

Simple table used but 2 with a manyToOne relation would make more sense (kept it simple for this workshop).

Must finish:
	displaying full todo list
	implement the editing and deleting
	add more validation on the back end
	maybe some css (who knows?)
